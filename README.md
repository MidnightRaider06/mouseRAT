# 🐭 mouseRAT

## Overview

**mouseRAT** is a minimalist Remote Access Tool (RAT) developed for **personal educational purposes**, focusing on:

- **Network programming fundamentals**
- **Command and Control (C2) development concepts**
- **Computer Network Operations (CNO) tooling**

This project is part of my personal learning journey in **security software development and offensive security engineering**.
